I hold a Masters in Computer Engineering degree from Syracuse University, USA and
worked for companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Silicon Valley Startups as a Senior/Staff Software Engineer.

I enjoy working with distributed micro-services, designing large scale systems, data models, and API's.

I am always learning and applying algorithms, data structures in day-to-day software development,
and will be sharing those learning in this blog.
